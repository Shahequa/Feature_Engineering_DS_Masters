    "Ordinal encoding and label encoding are two common techniques used to convert categorical data into numerical data for machine learning algorithms. \n",
    "\n",
    "Label encoding is a technique in which each unique value in a categorical feature is assigned a numerical label. For example, if we have a categorical feature called \"color\" with the values \"red\", \"blue\", and \"green\", we can encode them as 0, 1, and 2, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal encoding, on the other hand, is a technique that assigns a numerical value to each unique value in a categorical feature based on their order or rank. For example, if we have a categorical feature called \"education level\" with values \"high school\", \"some college\", \"bachelor's degree\", and \"master's degree\", we can encode them as 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively, since we can assume that someone with a master's degree has a higher education level than someone with a high school degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between label encoding and ordinal encoding is that label encoding does not consider any order or hierarchy among the unique values of the categorical feature, while ordinal encoding does.\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing between the two techniques, it depends on the nature of the categorical feature and the problem at hand. If there is a clear order or hierarchy among the unique values of the categorical feature, it may be more appropriate to use ordinal encoding. For example, if we are working with a dataset that has a categorical feature like \"education level\", ordinal encoding would be a better choice since there is a natural order to the different levels of education. On the other hand, if there is no clear order or hierarchy among the unique values of the categorical feature, label encoding may be more appropriate. For example, if we are working with a dataset that has a categorical feature like \"color\", there is no inherent order to the different colors."

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a type of ordinal encoding technique that replaces the categories with a number based on the target variable's mean or median value for each category. It is useful when there is a strong relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of how to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding in a machine learning project. Suppose you are working on a project that involves predicting the salary of employees in a company based on their job titles. You have a dataset that includes job titles and corresponding salaries for a sample of employees in the company. One way to use Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is to group the job titles by their mean salary and encode them accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, calculate the mean salary for each job title in the dataset. Then, sort the job titles by their mean salary, assigning a unique number to each job title based on their position in the sorted list. For example, suppose we have the following job titles and mean salaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manager: $100,000\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sales Associate: $50,000\n",
    "\n",
    "- Engineer: $75,000\n",
    "\n",
    "- Receptionist: $30,000\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we could encode the job titles using the following mapping:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Manager: 4\n",
    "- Engineer: 3\n",
    "- Sales Associate: 2\n",
    "- Receptionist: 1\n",
    "\n",
    "We assigned the number 4 to Manager because it has the highest mean salary, followed by 3 for Engineer, 2 for Sales Associate, and 1 for Receptionist. \n",
    "\n",
    "This encoding approach can be useful when the job title is an important feature for predicting salaries, and there is a clear relationship between job title and salary. By encoding the job title based on its relationship with salary, the resulting encoding can be a more informative feature for machine learning algorithms to use in predicting salary."

If we find a negative covariance, we can conclude that as age increases, income tends to decrease.\n",
